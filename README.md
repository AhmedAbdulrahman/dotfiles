What's it
----------
This is where I keep all my configs and automated scripts that I use when I set up a new environment for macOS.

What's inside
-------------
A lot of stuff and you can check them out in the file browser above. Main components are:

- [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/): Used for managing and installing macOS dependencies and [`Cask`](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) for managing and installing GUI apps like Chrome, Firefox, VSCode,...etc.
- [`Tmux`](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/): Used for pane and window management, copy-mode for navigating output, and session management make it a no-brainer for those who live in the terminal (and especially vim)
  ![Screenshot](assets/tmux.png)
- [`Neovim`](https://neovim.io): A drop-in replacement for Vim with my own customizations applied.
- [`ZSH`](http://www.zsh.org/): Shell with various customization:
  - [`üöÄSpaceships ZSH`](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) as a prompt.
  - [`üå∫ZPLUG`](https://zplug.sh) for dependency management.
  - ‚ö°Ô∏è Power up and beautify terminal with ZSH completions.

Setup
-----

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer! ‚ö†Ô∏è
These are **my** dotfiles, so **DO NOT** just run the `installer` snippet if you do not fully understand
[what it does](./installer.sh). Seriously, **DON'T**!

To set up the my `dotfiles`, run the appropriate snippet in the terminal:

| OS     | Snippet                                                                                                   |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `curl` | `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhmedAbdulrahman/dotfiles/master/installer.sh)"` |
| `wget` | `bash -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhmedAbdulrahman/dotfiles/master/installer.sh -O -)"`  |
| `git`  | `git clone git@github.com:AhmedAbdulrahman/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && source ~/dotfiles/installer.sh`     |

That's it! üéâ. When `installer` is run, you are prompted to choose one option from the list as seen below:
    ```bash
    What you want to do?

    1) All                      5) Install macOS Apps
    2) Install package manager  6) Change shell
    3) Clone Ahmeds dotfiles    7) Install XCode tools
    4) Symlink files            8) Quit

    Enter your choice (must be a number):               # Choose a number
    ```
The installer attempts to only select relevant script based on your choice. Say you choose `1` for `All`, then the process does a few things:

* Download `Homebrew` our main macOS dependency manager.
* Install Git if it's not installed in your machine.
* Install `ZSH` shell and set it as primary shell for your terminal.
* Clone my `dotfiles` repo on your computer (by default it will suggest `~/dotfiles`).
* Create some additional [directories][dirs].
* Symlink [`zsh`](zsh), [`vim`](vim), [`tmux`](tmux), [`files`](files), [`newsboat`](newsboat), [`extras/bin`](extras/bin) files.
* Install applications and command-line tools for [`macOS`](scripts/brew.zsh), [`Nodejs`](scripts/nodejs.zsh) including global packages, and [`Python`](scripts/python-packages.zsh) packages.
* Set custom [`macOS`](extras/macos/.macos) preferences.
* Install [`vim` plugins](vim/pack/bundle/start) as [`Git Submodules`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
