Make sure to use Neovim version 0.7+. After install configuration:

1. Treesitter Languages are not installed by default.\
Make sure to run `:TSInstall <lang>` for any language you want to install.
2. LSP servers are `enabled` by default. You can enable more servers in `lua/lsp/setup.lua` just by adding standard `lspconfig.<server>.setup` function or by creating your own file and requiring in `init.lua`.
If server is not installed, it will be installed automatically.

You can check installed LSP servers by `:LspInstallInfo`.

## Configuration
To change NvimConfig related config use the `config.lua` file.
To change Nvim settings use the `settings.lua` file.

| `SPC p f`    | Find file under cursor in project - it finds files in project which contains text under cursor. Useful when you name directories by component name in React and wants to go quickly to file. 'gd' is better but in some projects without TS or with mixed JS/TS it cannot work properly |
